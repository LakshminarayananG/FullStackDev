Parallel & Concurrent Transaction:

Parallel:
Both transactions T1 & T2 will start at the same point & at same time. 

Concurrent:
Need not occur at same time, but will have overlapping operations

Atomicity:
* The entire unit of work should succeed if all the operations succeed.
* At any point of time, a DB system must be in a consistent state


Consistency:
Any constraints that is enforced in a committed state should result in consistency

Isolation:
In case of concurrent control mechanism, when same data is to be updated in 2 sessions, it would be done in isolated way using a locking
mechanism. This mechanism is pessimistic locking and not recommended one since this would have impact on performance

Durability:
State of the system should be permanent. No data should be lost due to system crash / any other issues.
