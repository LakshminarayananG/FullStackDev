Steps when connecting to the database

1. Download the jdbc jar specific to the database
2. Add external jars to the build path
3. JDBC Steps:
	a. Load the driver
	b. Get the connection details  using URL, username & password
	c. Validate if connection is successful 
	
4. MySQL Steps:
	a. Load the driver
	b. Create connection using connection parameters url, username & password
	c. Create statement with the connection object
	d. Execute specific query using the statement & store in resultset if needed
	e. Retrieve the required value / column details from result set
	
	
Statement & Prepared Statement:
Whenever we use the statement, everytime it creates a query execution plan, whereas prepared statement will create the plan once and will
cache it for further execution.

The advantage is that with prepared statement, dynamic query execution is possible and also with statement, since query execution plan is
created everytime, it would have an impact on the performance
