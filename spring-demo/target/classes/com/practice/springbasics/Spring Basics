Spring makes Java development easier.
It is an opensource framework & takes care of most of the work done by the developer.


Each & every component can be tested independently. 

Benefits of Spring Framework:
Simple, lightweight & implementation becomes easier.
Can easily integrate with other frameworks.


Application classes in spring are called POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes. This is integrated with metadata.

Metadata: Configuration information

Spring framework is a light weight container.

Metadata has the information on the objects that needs to be created & on how they interact with other classes. Objects are created based 
on the information given. It resolves the dependencies and complete object lifecycle is taken care by the container.

Any object created inside the container is called as bean.

Resolving dependencies: 
IoC --> Inversion of Control  (Dependency Injection)
Object creation is done & entire lifecycle is managed by the container which could be injected depending on our need.


XML file is the metadata that has the information for the bean to be created by container & managed


ClassPathXMLApplicationContext  --> Class available in spring to create container
Application context --> Supports eager loading. Beans are created at the beginning and is available for use
Bean Factory--> Supports lazy loading. Beans are created whenever required. This is deprecated.


Bean Scope:
Generally refers to the lifetime of a bean


Spring Context:
Singleton - default
Prototype

Web Context - Web Application
Request 
Session


Any bean that is created by default is a singleton bean.

Singleton Bean:
caches the bean created and gives the same reference for all the subsequent requests.

Prototype --> Does not cache and gives a unique bean for every request
