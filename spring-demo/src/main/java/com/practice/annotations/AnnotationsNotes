* Bean can also be created using the annotations.

* Annotations introduced in java since JDK 5

4 basic annotations that could be used to create bean

Component
Service
Repository
Controller

Bean wouldn't be created using the xml, but the package to identify the annotation would be specified in the component scan in the xml file


Component:
* Would create a bean with the classname unless explicitly mentioned
Example:
@Component for a class named Example will create a bean named example
@Component("exam") will create a bean with the name exam irrespective of whatever the class name is.

Service, Repository & Controller also serves the same purpose of creating a bean but the area of usage differs between them

Component
Service  --> Busines logic layer 
Repository --> Database layer / DAO layer bean
Controller  --> Web Layer


@Named, @Inject, @Autowire
Named & Inject are java based annotations whereas autowire is spring based annotation.
